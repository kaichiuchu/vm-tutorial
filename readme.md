## Features

- Adjustable frame rate and instructions per second
- Comprehensive debugger with breakpoint support and tracing
- Full support for sawtooth, sine, square, and triangle sound waves
- OpenGL 4.1 support for rendering graphics

## Usage

The controls for the virtual machine are fixed to their respective physical
keyboard keys. If you'd want to tell the guest program A is being pressed, then
press A, likewise with any of the other keys.

The debugger won't be available for use unless you load a CHIP-8 program first.
