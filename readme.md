This repository hosts a work in progress CHIP-8 virtual machine implementation,
designed in a way to be used for teaching. The code will come first rather than
the actual plain English tutorial for the moment, for what good would any
tutorial project be without a reference implementation?

And thus, you might be asking yourself: "why would kaichiuchu not finish the
reference implementation first"? And the answer is: I believe in writing code
entirely in the open from start to production ready, if at all possible. In my
view, it is good taste to see how a project came to maturity from every stage
in its development. Furthermore, while I could have done this in private and
let commit history do its job for anyone curious, not very rational but I
wouldn't get the same feeling. Surely you can understand that, can't you?
